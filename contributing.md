Hey there. Looks like you want to contribute with an issue. Great. Here's what you have to do:
* Read through the steps on [Bug Reporting 101](http://vazkii.us/br101/) (You may skip this if you're already familiar with reporting issues, but it's good for newcomers);
* Note the following points:
  * Issues regarding MCPC+/Cauldron/Spigot/Sponge that are not reproducible with forge only are **not accepted**;
  * Issues regarding outdated versions of the mod are **not accepted**;
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature!) will be closed without asking. If the issue is still happening, comment on the old one with the proper info you'd use when reporting a new one. (if it's locked for some reason feel free to make another one)
  * Suggestions are **not** accepted here. Since quark is a mod for features that will go in vanilla, post your suggestions to [/r/minecraftsuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions) and tag me (/u/vazkii) if you want me to see it. I take notes of all features I intend on adding.

[Report the Issue](https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/issues)!

You can find me at most times on [#vazkii @ irc.esper.net](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=vazkii), if you need to speak with me about the issue you would report. Just make sure to use common sense and read what the bot tells you.

If you want to make a Pull Request keep these in mind:
* Do NOT use the github editor. Test your damn PRs before you submit them.
* I'm very strict when it comes to syntax. Make sure your PR's syntax matches the syntax of the rest of the code. That includes the lack of spacing after if/for/(etc), proper bracket usage, camel casing and copyleft headers on new classes.
* If your pull request edits very small chunks of code and isn't flawless I'll close it as it'll probably take less time to fix it myself rather than pull yours and change the code.
